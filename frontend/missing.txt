# Missing API Endpoints Analysis

After analyzing the frontend requirements and available API endpoints, I've identified the following missing API endpoints that are necessary for the frontend to function properly:

## 1. Timeline Management Endpoints

The frontend includes timeline views and management features, but there are no dedicated API endpoints for:

- GET /timeline/project/{id} - Get timeline for a specific project
- GET /timeline/phase/{id} - Get timeline for a specific phase
- POST /timeline/project/{id} - Update project timeline
- POST /timeline/phase/{id} - Update phase timeline

## 2. Statistics and Analytics Endpoints

The Statistics subtab requires specialized endpoints:

- GET /statistics/project/{id} - Get statistics for a specific project
- GET /statistics/phase/{id} - Get statistics for a specific phase
- GET /statistics/user/{id} - Get statistics for a specific user
- GET /statistics/team/{id} - Get statistics for a specific team

## 3. RACI Matrix Endpoints

The "Prepare for APQP" subtab mentions RACI Matrix setup, but no endpoints exist:

- GET /raci-matrix/project/{id} - Get RACI matrix for a project
- POST /raci-matrix/project/{id} - Create/update RACI matrix
- GET /raci-matrix/templates - Get RACI matrix templates

## 4. Advanced Filtering Endpoints

The frontend needs better filtering capabilities:

- GET /projects/filter - Filter projects by multiple criteria
- GET /history/filter - Filter history by user, date, action, etc.
- GET /outputs/filter - Filter outputs by status, user, deadline, etc.

## 5. Bulk Operations Endpoints

For efficiency, bulk operation endpoints are needed:

- POST /outputs/bulk-status-update - Update status of multiple outputs
- POST /phases/bulk-deadline-update - Update deadlines for multiple phases
- POST /todos/bulk-assign - Assign multiple todos at once

## 6. Analysis and Reporting Endpoints

For advanced analytics:

- GET /analyse/project/{id} - Get analysis data for a project
- GET /analyse/phase/{id} - Get analysis data for a phase
- GET /analyse/team/{id} - Get analysis data for a team
- POST /reports/generate - Generate custom reports

## 7. History Editor Endpoints

For managing history records:

- POST /history-editor/update-dates - Update dates in history records
- POST /history-editor/set-deadline - Set deadline for an entity
- GET /history-editor/get-deadline - Get deadline for an entity
- POST /history-editor/bulk-set-deadlines - Set deadlines for multiple entities

## 8. Workspace-specific Endpoints

For the workspace functionality:

- GET /workspace/inputs/{phaseId} - Get inputs for a specific phase
- GET /workspace/outputs/{phaseId} - Get outputs for a specific phase
- POST /workspace/link-input-output - Link an input to an output for traceability
