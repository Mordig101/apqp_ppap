Task List for API Fixes:

1. Detail View Issues (404 Errors):
   - Projects: GET/PUT/DELETE /api/projects/1/ not found
   - PPAPs: GET/PUT /api/ppaps/1/ not found
   - Phases: GET/PUT /api/phases/1/ not found
   - Outputs: GET/PUT /api/outputs/1/ not found
   - Teams: All detail operations (GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) /api/teams/1/ not found
   - Departments: All detail operations /api/departments/1/ not found
   - Persons: All detail operations /api/persons/1/ not found
   - Clients: All detail operations /api/clients/1/ not found
   - History: GET /api/history/1/ not found

2. Foreign Key Constraint Failures (500 Errors):
   - POST /api/projects/ - Foreign key constraint failed
   - POST /api/documents/ - Foreign key constraint failed
   - POST /api/users/ - Foreign key constraint failed

3. Missing API Endpoints (404 Errors):
   - POST /api/teams/1/assign_members/

4. Bad Request Issues (400 Errors):
   - POST /api/teams/ - Bad request
   - POST /api/departments/ - Bad request

Priority Order for Fixes:
1. Fix Foreign Key Constraint Issues (Most Critical - causing 500 errors)
2. Implement Missing API Endpoints (Important for core functionality)
3. Add Detail View Support (Required for CRUD operations)
4. Fix Bad Request Issues (Input validation/serialization issues)

Next Steps:
1. Review models to ensure foreign key relationships are properly defined
2. Add detail view methods in ViewSets
3. Implement missing API endpoints from api_view.py
4. Add proper validation in serializers for teams and departments
5. Test each endpoint after fixing to ensure proper functionality
